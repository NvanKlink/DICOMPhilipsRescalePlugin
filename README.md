DICOMPhilipsRescalePlugin
=========================

3D Slicer plugin for applying Philips-specific rescaling to scalar volume data on import from DICOM. The rescaling instructions were provided by Tom Chenevert, U.Michigan.

This plugin was used to process the data and provide the measurements using 3D Slicer, as described in the publication below:

Development of this plugin was supported in part by NIH through U01CA151261 (PI Fiona Fennessy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA), and was done as part of the activities of the NCI Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN), see http://imaging.cancer.gov/programsandresources/specializedinitiatives/qin.
